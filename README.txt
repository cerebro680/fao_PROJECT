4. The programs has stream reader automatically read in all four csv files. Please choose the designated directory as mentioned in the stream reader comments. The files are properly located in the repository, please change the directory as per your machine.

5. For Libraries and declarations, packages will be available if you click on the respective 'using functions'.

6. The Csv reader function has been debugged and tested. Unfortunately due to time, work and family constraints and emergencies, some exceptions weren't handled. It also has yet to implement outputting to json. The experimented bit of json code has been commented out due to further implementations. I sincerely hope these can be overlooked.

Thank you for your time and reading this.
